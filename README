Code for LED Wall
-----------------

Start local test client with terminal output:

  go run ./cmd/insta -term -life 10s -logo


See -help for other modes/animations. Most modes require a time argument (like 10s). The mode stops after this duration and the next starts. This will repeat indefinitely.
